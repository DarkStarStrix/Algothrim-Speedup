# Algothrim-Speedup
This code outlines the structure for benchmarking matrix multiplication with parallel processing. 
You would need to integrate this with other code snippets, such as those related to PyPy JIT compilation or other optimizations, to create a complete script that suits your specific requirements. 
Additionally, ensure that any external libraries or tools required for your optimizations are correctly configured in the code.
